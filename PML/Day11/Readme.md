       -Linear SVM
       -Kernel SVM


# Support Vector Machine:
-----------------------
       -SVM : supervised learning model used for classification and regression analysis.
       -defines a separating hyperplane for discriminative classification.
       
       -Representation: Data points in feature space mapped so that separate categories are divided by a decision boundray and marginal line.
       
       -Linear classification: SVM performs linear classification by finding an optimal hyperplane.
       
       -Non-linear classification:SVM can efficiently handle non-linear classification by implicitly mapping inputs into high dimensional feature space.
       
       -SVM identifies the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the training data.
       
       -Maximum Margin:The SVM algorithm maximizes the margin between the closest data point of differnt classes called as support vector.
       
       -SVM uses kernel functions to transform non-linearly separable data into higher dimensional spaces where it can be linearly separable.
       
       -SVM is capable of managing outliers by allowing soft margins, which introduce a penalty for misclassified points.


# Terminologies:
---------------
       1. Support vector:
       -points that are closest to the hyperplane.
       
       2.Margin:
       -The distance between the hyperplane and observation closest to the hyperplane.
       
       3.Hyperplane:
       -The decision boundary i.e., used to separate the data points of different classes in the feature space.
       
       4.Hard margin:
       -Maximum margin of hyperplane which separates the data points without any misclassification.
       
       5.Soft margin:
       -Data points are not perfectly separable.
       -Data points include slack variable for the formation of soft margin.

# Types of SVM:
--------------
       1. Linear SVM:
       -uses a linear decision boundary to separate data points, suitable for linearly separable data.
       
       2.Non-linear SVM:
       -uses kernel function to handle nonlinearly separable data by mapping it into higher dimensional space.

# Common Kernel functions:
-------------------------
       -Linear kernel 
       -Polynomial kernel
       -Gaussian RBF kernel
       -Sigmoid kernel

    # The problem statement
    In this project, I try to classify a pulsar star as legitimate or spurious pulsar star. The legitimate pulsar stars form a minority positive class and spurious pulsar stars form the majority negative class. I implement Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classification algorithm with Python and Scikit-Learn to solve this problem.
    
    To answer the question, I build a SVM classifier to classify the pulsar star as legitimate or spurious. I have used the Predicting a Pulsar Star dataset downloaded from the Kaggle website for this project.
    
    # Dataset description
    I have used the Predicting a Pulsar Star dataset downloaded from Dataset folder.
    
    Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter. Classification algorithms in particular are being adopted, which treat the data sets as binary classification problems. Here the legitimate pulsar examples form minority positive class and spurious examples form the majority negative class.
    
    The data set shared here contains 16,259 spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and 1,639 real pulsar examples. Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry. The class labels used are 0 (negative) and 1 (positive).
    
    # Attribute Information:
    Each candidate is described by 8 continuous variables, and a single class variable. The first four are simple statistics obtained from the integrated pulse profile. The remaining four variables are similarly obtained from the DM-SNR curve . These are summarised below:
    
    Mean of the integrated profile.
    
    Standard deviation of the integrated profile.
    
    Excess kurtosis of the integrated profile.
    
    Skewness of the integrated profile.
    
    Mean of the DM-SNR curve.
    
    Standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve.
    
    Excess kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve.
    
    Skewness of the DM-SNR curve.
